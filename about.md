# SetLuna – Learn Web Development the Fun Way 🌙✨

SetLuna is a gamified learning platform for web development, inspired by Duolingo. It's designed for absolute beginners and gradually builds toward React, TypeScript, and Next.js — with levels, XP, and future AI-powered code reviews based on your GitHub commits.

---

## 🧩 Why SetLuna?

Most platforms teach with:

- Boring videos
- No progress tracking
- No feedback or reward system

**SetLuna changes that.**

- Interactive lessons (HTML → JS → React → Next.js)
- Earn XP, streaks, badges, and level up
- Push your code to GitHub as you learn
- 🧠 _Future AI coach will analyze your commits and give personalized feedback_

### 🧭 Stage 2: JavaScript Basics

**Goal:** Add interactivity to your sites  
**Topics:**

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types, arrays, objects
- Functions and control flow
- DOM manipulation: events, input, buttons, changing content

✅ _Project: Interactive to-do list → committed to GitHub_

---

### 🧭 Stage 3: Intermediate JavaScript + APIs

**Goal:** Work with real data from the internet  
**Topics:**

- `fetch()` and JSON
- ES6+: arrow functions, destructuring, template literals
- Loops: `map`, `filter`, `forEach`
- Modular file structure

✅ _Project: Weather app using public API_

---

### 🧭 Stage 4: React – Building Modern Interfaces

**Goal:** Build UI using components  
**Topics:**

- JSX syntax
- Functional components
- State with `useState`
- Effects with `useEffect`
- Props and dynamic rendering

✅ _Project: Notes app or simple blog_

---

### 🧭 Stage 4.5: TypeScript – Safer Code

**Goal:** Add type safety to your components  
**Topics:**

- Basic types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`
- Arrays, objects, functions
- Union types and optional properties
- Typing props, state, and events

✅ _Project: Convert your React app to TypeScript_

---

### 🧭 Stage 5: Next.js – Build Fullstack Web Apps

**Goal:** Use a production-grade React framework  
**Topics:**

- File-based routing (`pages/` or `app/`)
- Server-side and static rendering
- API routes
- Project structure and layouts
- Styling with Tailwind CSS or CSS modules

✅ _Project: Blog or dashboard with dynamic content_

---

### 🧭 Stage 6: Real Apps – Auth, Database, Payments

**Goal:** Build real SaaS apps with user accounts and billing  
**Topics:**

- Auth (NextAuth.js or Clerk)
- Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- Stripe for payments
- Protected pages and CRUD operations

✅ _Project: User dashboard with login + subscriptions_

---

## 🧠 Future Features – GitHub AI Coach

Once Git is integrated:

- Connect your GitHub account to SetLuna
- Earn XP from good commit practices
- AI will:
  - Review your latest code
  - Suggest improvements
  - Track progress over time

💬 _Example_: "Looks like you haven't committed in 3 days. Ready for a quick coding challenge?"

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma or PlanetScale)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js or custom
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Hosting**: Vercel
